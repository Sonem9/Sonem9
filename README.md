- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sonem9 i am new in all the coding/hacking/programming stuff, but i am excited to learn as much as i can
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ethical hacking
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning network hacking and trying to learn linux

I am still trying to balance learning the things that i am interested in with school, so i will more than likely learn slower until I learn how to learn
